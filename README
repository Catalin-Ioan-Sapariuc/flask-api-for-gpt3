This is a flask APP which is a wrapper around the GPT3 models. 
Note that the "older" models (text-curie-001 and code-cushman-001) are more limited and accept 
only aproximately 2000 tokens for the entire completion. 
These have been added here in order to make a fuller image and for convenience. 

The main models to check and test are text-davinci-003 and code-davinci-002. 
Out of these two, code-davinci-002 appears to have a slight edge (be slightly better in its outputs)
however, I have often ran into the problem of it being overwhelmed with requests and therefore 
unaccessible. 
UPDATE (March 24): The code models (code-davinci-002 and code-cushman-001) seem to be 
"out of comission" (I get a model code-davinci-002 or model code-cushman-001 does not exist"
when querried, although these were working yesterday (with the mention from above). 
Accordingly, I took them out of our options. We will wait and see! 


The main goal of the project is to train this models on own (Blueprint) datas \
and to access the answers for these trained models. 
For this particular flask wrapper, the answers are conveniently accessed straight trough the 
web page. 

To run the app: 
Have installed:
openai (+v.0.26)
flask 
pickle5
tiktoken
pandas
numpy 



After cloning, at the main directory (which contains the app.py) simply run:
flask run. 
Enjoy!
